# PortfolioSite

Static site for myself and the various things I want to share

## Requirements

- Ruby
- Bundler

On macOS, you can install Ruby and Bundler using Homebrew:

```bash
brew install ruby
gem install bundler
```

You may need to use `rbenv` to install a version of Ruby that works with Bundler. 

For example: 
```bash
brew install rbenv
rbenv install 3.3.6
rbenv global 3.3.6
```

## Setup

```bash
bundle install
bundle exec jekyll serve
```
