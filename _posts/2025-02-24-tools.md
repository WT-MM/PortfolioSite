### Hi

As a robotics engineer, I've found a set of really useful (mostly software) tools for a more ergonomic work environment. This is also something that I'll likely update as I find better tools. Generally, the software tools listed are free. 

### Mac Tools

[Shottr](https://shottr.cc/){:target="_blank"} - screenshot tool that allows you easily markup screenshots and copy to clipboard. Also has an OCR function (which I have actually used sometimes when I mess up my tmux config and need to copy text)

[Rectangle](https://rectangleapp.com/){:target="_blank"} - window manager with nice shortcuts for managing windows, especially across multiple monitors.

[BetterDisplay](https://github.com/waydabber/BetterDisplay#readme){:target="_blank"} - I'm not totally sold on this one, especially since it costs money, but it's been handy for multi-monitor setups and was very useful for backing up my computer when the screen went out,

### General Software

[Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/download){:target="_blank"} - Mesh VPN that's really handy for connecting to devices that are physically distant.


### Personal Tools

[dotfiles](https://github.com/WT-MM/dotfiles){:target="_blank"} - personal dotfiles to quickly set up new machines. Very fond of my git and zsh aliases. 

### Physical Tools

[Milwauke Fastback](https://www.milwaukeetool.com/products/48-22-1502){:target="_blank"} - Folding utility knife with space for spare blades. It's pocket-sized and feels great to snap open.
