## Greed

**When I was younger, my Taiwanese grandparents would often ask if I was a "饭桶" or a "面桶," which I at the time took to mean if I was a rice guy or a noodle guy. When I ask ChatGPT now, it tells me that they may also have been insulting me.**

## Cope
*I've never asked other people how often they disassociate, but I feel like I do it maybe a bit more often than median. In the past half-year (I feel as though my time at K-Scale was in an environment especially catered to my psyche), I feel that I've disassociated perhaps 2-3 times.*

## The Story
**In response, I would always say "我是都桶," which I thought meant "I'm an everything guy." Growing up, I was pretty heavy, a trait that I continue to deal with today.** 

*I'm not sure if what I experience truly is disassociation, but whatever it is that I experience, I will label it as such. I don't quite remember what it feels like until I experience it again. But it's always numb. I might want to hit something. Sometimes it's fatigue. Sometimes it's depressive.*

**I'm a particularly greedy person, often to the point of self-sabotage. In fact, I am so reliably greedy, I might as well be a caricature.** 

*There is only one instance that has truly stuck in my mind, which happened on what felt like a random day in my senior year of high school. It's the only one that I don't truly have an explanation for, yet the most visceral and literal example of disassociation I've ever felt. For just an instant, I was watching myself in third person, perched a little more than 2 lengths of a length from my body above my body. Navigating through a crowd of high schoolers after AP Lit, I didn't feel anything in particular. Just detachment in both the emotional and physical sense.* 

**In video games, I over-optimize to the point where I die more often because of a stupid risk than something more structural. For example, take any rogue-like, 4X, deck builder, whatever type of game you play. In Civ 6, my build queue looks like "scout scout builder." In Faster Than Light, I'd rather skip out on the hull repair than risk not being able to buy a stealth module later on.** 

*The only real explanation I can give is that I'm environmentally autistic (self-diagnosed). That is, I don't think it stems from genetics but through my own life choices and experiences. Socially, I'm a wreck. Because I'm bad at it, I often become stressed and feel out of place.*

**In my life, I'm especially greedy. But not in a very beneficial way. It's greed exhibiting as a desire to sample everything in a shallow manner and an inability to settle until I am forced to. I spread myself thin in an uncreative manner. For instance, right now I'm taking 10 "classes" (7 if you exclude labs). I'm also nominally in a research lab and a leader, in some capacity, of two clubs.** 

*I've always been particularly bad at social interactions. I was always the kid who read books in the library during recess. In fact, my friend in elementary school once said he could count the words I said in a day on one hand.*

**I also think constantly about exploring personal projects. Making a robot arm, neural planners, voice reconstruction from IMUs, recreating coke, fully automated mentions market bot. These are some of the things that have crossed my mind in the past few weeks.** 

**Since I came back to school last semester,** *I've also tried to be more social.* **I try to talk to people more, keep up my socials a little better,** *go out with friends.* 

## Me
I quite literally may have met more people in this past semester than my entire freshman year. Yet, when going out, I inevitably and invariably come to disassociate or something very close to it *only if* I am sober. There are a series of further topics there, but they are out of scope. 

Because I'm a greedy person, I am often unsatisfied. I feel like there is always something better to strive for. By itself, I don't think this is necessarily a bad thing. However, I think that I am so used to this state of dissatisfaction that when there is something worth attaining/achieving/completing, I functionally shut down. I create new problems to solve, investigate, and otherwise waste my time on. In a way, this entire entry is one of those false works to fixate on that I create solely to avoid something worthwhile.

**Because I'm so often busy yet "running in place,"** I feel that I'm placing a lot of stress on myself. 

*Because I''m mildly socially autistic*, I think that my disassociations are caused by stressful social interaction. In a very camel-back-breaking way, even minimally difficult social interactions cascade on top of general stress.

Because I don't think I can ever stop being a greedy person, the only solution is to make every social experience a comfortable experience. As of now, I think there are likely two avenues: 
* believe that nothing matters (very nihilistic)
* believe that everything matters (in an existentialist sense).

I would like to believe that everything matters and thus "self-actualize," but it is significantly easier to take the nihilistic approach. 

My main regret used to be that there wasn't enough energy or time in the world. I think I've come to realize that my true regret is that I'm so bad at changing my nature.
