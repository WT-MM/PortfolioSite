        <h3 class="text-center">Hey There, I'm Wesley</h3>
        <p>Thanks for checking out my website! I'm currently a junior at Palo Alto High School, though I've
          spent most of my life in Japan at <a href="https://www.asij.ac.jp/" target="_blank">ASIJ</a> and in Indonesia at <a href="https://www.jisedu.or.id/" target="_blank">JIS</a>.
        </p>
        <p>Though I was born in Palo Alto, I spent most of my early childhood in Japan before moving to Indonesia during my middle childhood and moving back to Japan again during the start of my adolescence.
          Now, I'm back in Palo Alto, and I've picked up a little Japanese and Bahasa alongside the Chinese and English I already speak at home.
        </p>
        <p>
          While moving around across Asia, I discovered a passion for creating things that, though began with intricate 2D tile structures and Legos, developed into a love for programming and robotics.
        </p>
        <p>
          I first stumbled into programming when I logged onto <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/wesleymaa/" target="_blank">Scratch</a> for the first time. Before I knew it, I was spending hours everyday on the site and
          by the time I left the platform, I had made over 100 projects, some of which have endured to this day. 
        </p>
        <p>
          My introduction to Scratch eventually led me down to text-based programming languages, where I now program robots in Java and develop automation tools in Python. 
        </p>
        <p>
          When it came to robotics, I started from my middle school's VEX Robotics Competition team. Here, I also discovered an exhilarating activity in robotics and would go on to sink countless hours 
          in the school's makeshift robotics lab, both after school and on the weekends.
        </p>
        <p>
          Entering high school, I carried my love for robotics with me and co-founded a <a href="https://jumprobotics.org" target="_blank">FIRST Robotics Competition team</a>, where I now can design and create a robot from scratch every year with other passionate teammates.
        </p>
        <p>Since then, I've continued to work on robotics with my teammates and explore a ton of fascinating projects that you can check out <a href="../projects/">here</a>!</p>
