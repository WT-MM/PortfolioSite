            <p>Thanks for checking out my website!
            <br><br>
            Right now, I'm studying Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at Columbia University, but my journey's taken me around the world, from being born in California to growing up in Tokyo and Jakarta to where I currently live in New York City.</p>
            <p>While moving all over the place, I discovered one important fixture: a passion for creating that began with 2D tile structures and Legos but has since evolved into a love for programming, robotics, and other assorted rabbit holes.</p>
            <p>My first real foray into making happened by accident when I logged onto <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/wesleymaa/" target="_blank">Scratch</a> for the first time. Before I knew it, I was spending hours everyday on the site and by the time I left the platform, I had made everything from games to math visualizations to an experimental setup to analyze my classmates.</p>
            <p>This intro to programming, and really the internet, led me to dive deeper into the world of software, where I now control robots with Rust, develop cool tools with Python, and guide satellites with C++.</p>
            <p>In middle school and high school, I discovered (first) the VEX Robotics Competition and (then) the FIRST Robotics Competition. I became obsessed with robotics and would spend countless hours in our makeshift robotics lab every chance I could get, even going on to start an <a href="https://jumprobotics.org" target="_blank">FRC team</a> with some new friends to design and build completely new robots every year.</p>
            <p>After my first year of college, I spent another year working on some cool open-source humanoid robots at <a href="https://kscale.dev" target="_blank">K-Scale</a> as a founding engineer where I learned the full robot software stack from firmware to ML and how startups work.</p>
            <p>Since then, I've continued to work on robotics and explore a ton of fascinating projects that you can check out <a href="/projects">here</a>!</p>
