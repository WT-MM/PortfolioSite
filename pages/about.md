            <p>Thanks for checking out my website!
            <br><br>
            Right now, I'm studying Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at Columbia University, but my journey's taken me around the world, from being born in California to growing up in Tokyo and Jakarta to where I currently live in New York City.</p>
            <p>While moving around across Asia, I discovered a passion for creating things that began with intricate 2D tile structures and Legos but developed into a love for programming and robotics.</p>
            <p>My first real foray into creating happened by accident when I logged onto <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/wesleymaa/" target="_blank">Scratch</a> for the first time. Before I knew it, I was spending hours everyday on the site and by the time I left the platform, I had made over a hundred different projects which are (of course) all world-class masterpieces ðŸ˜€.</p>
            <p>This intro to 'programming' led me to dive deeper into the world of software, where I now control robots with Rust, develop automation tools with Python, and guide satellites with C++.</p>
            <p>The other defining moment in my life was when I discovered the VEX Robotics Competition in middle school. There, I realized an obsession for robotics that would lead me to sink countless hours in my school's makeshift robotics lab every chance I could get.</p>
            <p>That love for robotics came with me as I entered high school, where some friends and I started a <a href="https://jumprobotics.org" target="_blank">FIRST Robotics Competition team</a>. There, I designed and built a robot every year with my fellow passionate teammates.</p>
            <p>Since then, I've continued to work on robotics and explore a ton of fascinating projects that you can check out <a href="/projects">here</a>!</p>
